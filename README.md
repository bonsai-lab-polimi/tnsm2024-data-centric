To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first publicly available dataset comprising telemetry data from real, in-production microwave networks, collected over several years and painstakingly labeled by domain experts.


The dataset is composed of 1669 entries (rows) with labels (0, 1, 2, and 3) corresponding to the microwave hardware failure cause, and a total of 164 columns of features (i.e., alarms). 


*Disclaimer: 
This is the first version of the shared dataset. In time we will enrich the description. 
We suggest reading the manuscript associated with the dataset for further details.
